            Ingredients:

1 lb of pappardelle pasta
4 tablespoons of unsalted butter
1 medium onion, finely chopped
4 cloves of garlic, minced
1 pound of mixed mushrooms, sliced
1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup of Konjac flour
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh parsley leaves, chopped (optional)
Instructions:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pappardelle pasta according to package instructions, until al dente.
In a separate pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until soft and translucent.
Add the mushrooms to the pan and cook until they have released their liquid and are tender.
Stir in the Konjac flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the flour has thickened.
Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce, tossing until evenly coated.
Serve hot, topped with freshly chopped parsley leaves, if desired. Enjoy!
