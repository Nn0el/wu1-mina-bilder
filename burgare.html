1 tablespoon of tomato paste
1 teaspoon of paprika
1 teaspoon of dried thyme

4 whole wheat buns
Lettuce leaves

<p>For the fries:</p>

    <p>4 medium potatoes, cut into wedges
3 tablespoons of vegetable oil
Salt and pepper to taste</p>

<p>For the salad:</p>

<p>4 cups of mixed greens
1 medium carrot, grated
1 medium cucumber, sliced
1/2 cup of cherry tomatoes, halved
1/4 cup of balsamic vinaigrette</p>

<p>For the dip sauce:</p>

<p>1/2 cup of mayonnaise
1/2 cup of ketchup
1 teaspoon of mustard
1 teaspoon of paprika

<p>Instructions:</p>

    <p>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Drain and rinse the soaked soybeans and pulse in a food processor until crumbly.
In a large bowl, mix together the processed soybeans, onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, soy sauce, tomato paste, paprika, thyme, salt, and pepper. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and form each into a patty.
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties until browned on both sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes, until fully cooked through.
Toss the potatoes with the remaining oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them out in a single layer on another baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, until crispy and golden.
In a large bowl, mix together the mixed greens, grated carrot, sliced cucumber, halved cherry tomatoes, and balsamic vinaigrette.
In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, paprika, salt, and pepper to make the dip sauce.
Toast the buns and assemble the burgers with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and any other condiments or cheese of your choice. Serve with the baked fries and mixed greens salad, along with the dip sauce. Enjoy!
